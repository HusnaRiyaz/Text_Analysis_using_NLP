# Text_Analysis_using_NLP
# Objective:
      The objective of this project is to develop a pipeline for extracting textual data from articles available at a given URL and to perform comprehensive text analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The key tasks include:

            1)Extracting text content from the provided URL.
            2)Cleaning and preprocessing the extracted text data.
            3)Analyzing the text to compute specific variables, such as:
                    a)Positive score
                    b)Negative score
                    c)Polarity score
                    d)Subjectivity score
                    e)Avg sentence length
                    f)Percentage of complex words
                    g)Fog index
                    h)Avg words per sentence
                    i)Complex word count
                    j)Word count
                    k)Syllable per word
                    l)Personal pronouns
                    m)Avg word length
 # Summary:           
      > Generating insights and visualizations from the analyzed data to aid in understanding the key themes and sentiments expressed in the articles.
      > This project aims to demonstrate the application of NLP methods to extract, process, and analyze textual data, providing meaningful insights from online articles.
